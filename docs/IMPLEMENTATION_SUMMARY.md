# Role-Based Signup & Login System with Admin Approval - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to implement a complete role-based authentication system with admin approval for factory and collector roles.

## Overview

The implementation includes:
- Role-based user registration (user, factory, collector, admin)
- Admin approval workflow for factory and collector accounts
- Enhanced signup forms with role-specific fields
- Pending approval dashboard for factory/collector users
- Admin dashboard integration for approval management
- Email notifications for approval status changes
- API documentation and testing instructions

## Backend Changes

### 1. Database Models

**Updated User Model** (`database/models/User.js`)
- Added `approvalStatus` field (pending, approved, rejected)
- Added `rejectionReason` field for rejected applications

**New Factory Application Model** (`database/models/FactoryApplication.js`)
- Stores factory-specific registration data
- Tracks application status and review information

**New Collector Application Model** (`database/models/CollectorApplication.js`)
- Stores collector-specific registration data
- Tracks application status and review information

### 2. Authentication Routes

**Enhanced Auth Routes** (`routes/authRoutes.js`)
- Modified registration endpoint to handle role-specific data
- Updated login endpoint to check approval status
- Integrated email notifications for registration confirmation

**New Admin Approval Routes** (`routes/adminApprovalRoutes.js`)
- Endpoints for managing factory/collector applications
- Approve/reject functionality with reasons
- Filtering and pagination support

### 3. Middleware

**New Approval Middleware** (`middleware/approvalMiddleware.js`)
- Checks approval status for protected factory/collector routes
- Prevents access to features until approved

**Updated Route Protection**
- Applied approval middleware to factory and collector routes
- Ensures only approved users can access role-specific features

### 4. Utilities

**Notification Service** (`utils/notificationService.js`)
- Mock email system for development
- Configurable for production SMTP
- Notifications for registration and approval status changes

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Enhanced Signup Form

**Updated Signup Component** (`client/src/pages/Signup.tsx`)
- Dynamic form fields based on selected role
- Factory-specific fields (factory name, owner, GST)
- Collector-specific fields (company name, contact, service areas)
- Improved UX with role-specific sections

### 2. Pending Approval Dashboard

**New Pending Approval Component** (`client/src/pages/PendingApproval.tsx`)
- Dedicated page for factory/collector users awaiting approval
- Status display (pending, approved, rejected)
- Rejection reason display
- Refresh functionality

### 3. Admin Dashboard Integration

**Updated Admin Dashboard** (`client/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`)
- New "Approvals" tab in navigation
- Integrated approval management interface

**New Approval Management Component** (`client/src/components/ApprovalManagement.tsx`)
- Table view of all applications
- Filtering by status and type
- Inline approve/reject actions
- Rejection reason input

### 4. Service Layer Updates

**Enhanced Admin Service** (`client/src/services/adminService.ts`)
- New methods for approval management
- Type definitions for approval applications
- Error handling improvements

**Updated Auth Service** (`client/src/services/api.ts`)
- Extended register method to handle role-specific data
- Updated type definitions

**Enhanced Auth Context** (`client/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Updated User interface with approval fields
- Backward-compatible register method

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Role-based registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login with approval status check

### Admin Approval
- `GET /api/admin/approval/factories/pending` - Get pending factory applications
- `GET /api/admin/approval/collectors/pending` - Get pending collector applications
- `GET /api/admin/approval/applications` - Get all applications with filtering
- `PUT /api/admin/approval/factories/:id/approve` - Approve factory application
- `PUT /api/admin/approval/factories/:id/reject` - Reject factory application
- `PUT /api/admin/approval/collectors/:id/approve` - Approve collector application
- `PUT /api/admin/approval/collectors/:id/reject` - Reject collector application

## Security Features

1. **Password Security**
   - bcrypt hashing with 10 rounds
   - Minimum 8 character passwords

2. **Token Security**
   - JWT access and refresh tokens
   - Secure token storage

3. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Middleware for role verification
   - Approval status checks for factory/collector roles

4. **Input Validation**
   - Server-side validation of all inputs
   - Sanitization of user data

## Testing and Documentation

### Documentation
- Setup instructions (`docs/role-based-auth-setup.md`)
- API documentation with examples
- Curl command examples (`docs/curl-examples.md`)
- Implementation summary (this document)

### Testing
- Backend test script (`tests/auth-test.js`)
- Manual testing instructions
- Postman collection ready

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**
   - MongoDB connection
   - JWT secrets
   - SMTP configuration (optional)

2. **Production Security**
   - HTTPS required
   - Proper JWT secret management
   - Rate limiting for auth endpoints

3. **Email Notifications**
   - Console logging in development
   - SMTP configuration for production

## Key Features Implemented

✅ **Role-Based Registration**
- Users, factories, and collectors have distinct registration flows
- Admin accounts created separately via script

✅ **Admin Approval Workflow**
- Factory and collector accounts require admin approval
- Applications stored separately with detailed information
- Approval/rejection with reasons

✅ **User Experience**
- Clear feedback during registration
- Dedicated pending approval dashboard
- Status notifications

✅ **Admin Interface**
- Comprehensive approval management
- Filtering and search capabilities
- Audit trail of approvals

✅ **Notifications**
- Registration confirmation emails
- Approval status change notifications
- Mock system for development

✅ **Security**
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure password handling

## How It Works

1. **Registration**
   - User selects role during signup
   - Role-specific fields are collected
   - Factory/collector accounts marked as "pending"
   - Regular users automatically approved

2. **Login**
   - Approved users access their dashboards directly
   - Pending approval users redirected to approval dashboard
   - Rejected users shown rejection reason

3. **Admin Approval**
   - Admins review pending applications
   - Can approve or reject with reasons
   - Users notified of status changes via email

4. **Post-Approval**
   - Approved factory/collector users gain full access
   - Rejected users can contact support
   - Status tracked in user records

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready role-based authentication system with admin approval workflow that can be deployed immediately.
